<h1 class="sr-only">Creative Spaces Community</h1>

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](/conduct) 

This is a living repo and it will evolve alongside the community. It's primary use will be to capture the core values of the community, formats of the sessions, and coordinating project and experiment ideas.

## Purpose & Values 

* A safe space for people to be creative with the web
* A space for enthusiasts to tinker and experiment 
* A place where you can bring your projects
* Or collaborate with someone who’s already started one

This kind of sandbox environment can enable you to test new ideas to take back to your teams, get feedback from others so you can iterate, or just simply be creative if that’s all you want to do.

## Format Ideas

All of these formats must adhere to the community guidelines.

### Show & Tell

A forum to share something you've been working on. This could range from something you've been working on to something you've been intrigued by.

### Internal & External Speakers

This would require a fair bit of organization (especially the external speakers), but this would be nice to expand our reach.

### Hack and learn

A day event where we can collaborate on a theme, either altogether or in small groups. The purpose of this format is to work together on a problem while potentially learning something new.

### Bake-off

Akin to a multi-day hack and learn. We can use this longer-format session to solve the same problem with different tools and approaches. The purpose of this is to collaborate but also evaluate tools and ideas quickly. An example of a session would be to build a website, but the constraints would be to either use a novel tool/framework or that it should load no JavaScript. At the end of the session, we can share our learnings so we can compare and contrast the approaches and tools we've explored. This could be used as a sandbox environment to validate questions and concerns we might have in other areas of work.

### Hasan's Hot Takes™ (discontinued)

> REASON: While we can still have conversations that are provocative, critical, analytical and in good spirit, I think it's problematic to even brand it as a "hot take". I find “hot takes” need a very specific tone and context to foster any meaningful discussion and debate. More often than not, it descends into unproductive one-sided conversations.

This would be a time-blocked discussion (similar to lean coffee) where we can discuss any hot take related to the web and being creative with the web. The aim for it is to be provocative, critical and analytical, all the while being inclusive of others in the discussion.

An example of a hot take would be: "HTML & CSS are complex and hard". The discussion that follows would aim to dissect what about HTML and CSS might be complex, what are some pain points and how are we addressing them day-to-day, and etc.
